 <div align="justify">EMI-Experimental-Temperature-Variations comprises datasets and information pertinent to research in Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) via the Electromechanical Impedance (EMI) technique. The studies were carried out on a 6063-T5 aluminum alloy beam with PSI-5H4E piezoelectrics transducers (PTZs) from Piezo Systems attached to its surface. This benchmark details the experimental procedures employed for data acquisition. <br><br>
The experiments consisted of collecting electromechanical impedance signals for an undamaged structural condition, at different temperatures, using piezoelectric transducers attached to the structure in symmetrical and asymmetrical configurations. In addition, EMI signals for a beam with symmetric and asymmetric corrosion-type damage were obtained exclusively using symmetrically coupled PZTs, at different ambient temperatures. Finally, EMI measurements were performed for a free piezoelectric transducer, i.e., uncoupled from any structure, under different thermal conditions. This dataset is valuable for validating EMI-based SHM algorithms at different temperatures.

## 2. Experiment to collect EMI signals

This section presents the various experimental tests conducted. The methodology for measuring electromechanical impedance signals is outlined for four distinct cases. In the first one, EMI signals are measured from an undamaged beam with a PZT coupled in an asymmetric configuration. The second and third cases investigate, respectively, an undamaged and a damaged beam with symmetrically coupled PZTs. In the fourth and final case, an uncoupled PZT is examined. All analyses were performed considering variations in ambient temperature.

### 2.1. Undamaged Beam with Asymmetrically Coupled PZT

The experiment consisted of collecting electromechanical impedance signals from a 6063-T5 aluminum alloy beam containing a PSI-5H4E piezoelectric transducer, from *Piezo Systems*$$^\circledR$$, asymmetrically placed on the structure in relation to its longitudinal direction, as shown in Fig. 1

The following Fig. 2 shows a schematic of the experimental setup utilized. It was used a National Instruments board, model NI-USB 6211 (16 bits); a computer containing the software with the impedance analyzer developed by Baptista and Filho (2009) in LabVIEW environment; and a protoboard containing a resistance of 10 *k*Ω, which acts as an auxiliary circuit whose function is to limit the voltage in the piezoelectric transducer, thus avoiding potential damage to this device. The data acquisition (DAQ) board is responsible for capturing the response signal and, simultaneously, transmitting the excitation signal to the piezoelectric transducer. The excitation signal is generated by the impedance analyzer, which also calculates the electromechanical impedance based on the response signal captured by the DAQ.

The aluminum beam was placed inside a thermal chamber from the brand *Thermotron*$$^\circledR$$ *S-Series* to simulate ambient temperature variations, as depicted in Fig. 3(a). The beam was positioned on a foam layer to replicate a free-free boundary condition, as shown in Fig. 3(b). Geometric and material properties of the piezoelectric transducer and the beam at 24°C are presented in the Tabs. 1 and 2, respectively.

The signals were measured in a temperature range from 24°C to 70°C, which correspond to a large portion of the structures in operation. It was utilized a step of 5°C for the non-damage condition. In order to excite the structure, it was applied a sinusoidal frequency sweep with an amplitude of ±1 V in a frequency range of 1 Hz to 100 *k*Hz, with a step size of 1 Hz. The measurements were performed increasing the temperature and after 30 min of achieving the steady state for each one. Thirty signals were collected for each temperature and a sampling rate of 250 *k*S/s was employed.

### 2.2. Undamaged Beam with Symmetrically Coupled PZTs

To obtain the electromechanical impedance signals corresponding to the different structural dynamics (longitudinal and flexural), two PSI-5H4E piezoelectric transducers were symmetrically coupled to either side of the 6063-T5 aluminum alloy beam, as shown in Fig. 4. The experimental setup employed for data acquisition was identical to that described in Subsection 2.1 (see Fig. 2), with the exception that the object of study in this case involves a beam with two coupled piezoelectric transducers, rather than a single asymmetrically coupled PZT as investigated in the former analysis. The geometric properties of the PZTs and the beam are presented in Tabs. 3 and 4, respectively. As the same piezoelectric ceramics and beam utilized in the previous analysis (detailed in Subsection 2.1 and outlined in Tabs. 1 and 2) were employed here, their material properties have been omitted to avoid redundancy.

The connection arrangement between the piezoelectric transducers for generating longitudinal and flexural waves is shown in Fig. 5. This configuration is essential for the proper excitation of the different dynamics, allowing the PZTs to operate in a complementary manner and promote the appropriate stresses, be they axial forces (longitudinal dynamics) or bending moments (flexural dynamics).

The electromechanical impedance signals were acquired over a temperature range of 24°C to 65°C, with increments of 10°C. The beam, inserted in a thermal chamber (Fig. 6), was excited by a frequency sweep sinusoidal signal (*chirp*) with an amplitude of ±1 V, covering a range from 1 Hz to 100 *k*Hz, with a step of 1 Hz. In order to guarantee the reliability of the results, 10 sets of data were collected for each temperature, exclusively during the heating of the beam and after 30 min of achieving the steady state for each temperature. The sampling rate used was 250 *k*S/s.

### 2.3. Damaged Beam with Symmetrically Coupled PZTs

In order to obtain the electromechanical impedance signals of the damaged beam, the experimental configuration of the former tests, represented in Fig. 2, was replicated. The same system considered in the previous study, which covers different dynamics, was investigated with the aim of examining the effects of structural damage in different vibration contexts. The characteristics of the PZTs and the beam are detailed in the Tabs. 3 and 4, respectively, at a temperature of 24°C. Two damage configurations $-$ symmetric and asymmetric cross-sectional area reductions $-$ were introduced independently, with each damage type applied to a separate beam specimen, ensuring that only one form of damage was present per structure. Both damage types measured 25 mm in length, were positioned 94 mm from the PZTs, and extended across the full width of the beam. The damages were machined using a Emco Emcotronic Computer Numerically Controlled (CNC) lathe, model F1, shown in Fig. 7. For the symmetric damage cases, two identical thickness reductions were introduced on the upper and lower surfaces of the beam, resulting in total cross-sectional area reductions of 3%, 6%, and 15% relative to the beam's original thickness (3 mm), as shown in Fig. 8. Conversely, the asymmetric damage involved material removal from only one surface of the beam, with cross-sectional area reductions of 5%, 10%, and 20%, as shown in Fig. 8.

The electromechanical impedance signals were collected over a temperature range of 24 °C to 65 °C, in increments of 20 °C. A sinusoidal frequency sweep (*chirp*) with an amplitude of ± 1 V, spanning from 1 Hz to 100 *k*Hz in 1 Hz steps, was employed to excite the structure via the PZTs. For each temperature level, ten datasets were acquired using a sampling rate of 250 *k*S/s. Measurements were taken after gradually raising the temperature and maintaining thermal steady state for 30 minutes at each target value.

It is noteworthy that temperature variation was applied exclusively to the configuration with symmetric damage. In contrast, the asymmetric damage condition was evaluated solely at 24 °C. All other experimental parameters remained consistent across both damage scenarios.

### 2.4. Free PZT

The experimental tests consisted of collecting electromechanical impedance signals from the PSI-5H4E piezoelectric transducer, from *Piezo Systems*$$^\circledR$$, shown in Fig. 9. The geometric characteristics of this transducer are detailed in Tab. 5. These properties are identical to those used in the experimental tests of the coupled system (beam and asymmetrically coupled PZT), guaranteeing repeatability of the test conditions.

| -- | -- | -- |

|Width |$$b_p$$ |12 mm|
|Thickness |$$h_p$$ |0.2667 mm|

The experimental setup employed for data acquisition was identical to that used in Subsection 2.1 (see Fig. 2), with the exception that, in this case, the object of study is a free piezoelectric transducer, as depicted in Fig. 10. Electromechanical impedance signals were collected at temperatures of 24°C, 45°C and 70°C. This was achieved using a *chirp* sinusoidal sweep with an amplitude of ±1 V, spanning a frequency range from 1 Hz to 100 *k*Hz, in increments of 1 Hz. The sampling rate was 250 *k*S/s, and 10 sets of signals were obtained for each temperature. The measurements were taken exclusively during the heating process of the piezoelectric element and after maintaining a steady state for 30 minutes at each temperature. It should be noted that the high fragility of the PZT, combined with the vibrations of the thermal chamber itself and, above all, the circulating air currents within, caused disturbances to the piezoelectric transducer, which compromised the EMI and led to negative interference in the signals, such as increased noise.
